this is simple note app build it swift uikit framework basically i use to store data in mongodb 
so i used nodejs to store mongodb data from user interface and also i used package called ```Alamofire``` 
this package save u time it also helps u to call api

to find more about [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) in git repositry read there documentation 

if u want to use api in mobile try to change ```localhost``` into your ip open you terminal and write this ```ifconfig en0```
download api from my repositry [Note Api](https://github.com/abdorizak/take-Note-App-API)
